model (y = beta zero + beta 1 x + epsillon

Test hypothesis is not beta hat.

The true std of beta hat 1 = true variance / (sqrt(SSx [sum squared of x]))

- Since we do not know sigma (true variance) we use s

if your confidence interval contains null hypothesis we fail to reject the null value. 

If null confidence in the confidence interval we fail to reject

Coefficient of determination, r^2
- How much the errors of prediction of y are reduced by using the information provided by x

- Interpretation: The proportion (or percent) of sample variation in the y that is explained byt he presence of the x in the regression model.

- r^2 = (SSyy-SSE)/SSyy = explained variation / total variation

for GOLF sas
- infinle add the parameter (dlm='09X firstobs =2;)
